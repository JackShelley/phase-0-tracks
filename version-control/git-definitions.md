# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way of saving previous/alternate versions of your projects. This makes sure your files are backed up in case you lose or destroy your computer, or in case you mess up your project later on you can always go back to a working state.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a way to add edits to a file/repository while not changing the original file. It's particularly useful when a file needs several items added, all unique from eachother, that all need to be added together in the end. This allows you to mess up and not destroy your entire project, just part of it (:
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is basically creating a save point for your project. A good commit message will include *detailed* information about the changed you made. Should be specific enough to where someone else can read them and understand the changes.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two changes are made that contradict one another. For example, one person changes a line with a different value and the other person changes the same line with a different value. Git doesn't know which one to use so it causes a merge conflict
