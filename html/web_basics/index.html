  	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
 	<p>Putting a link to Google is really this <a href="http://google.com">easy!</a></p>
 	<strong>My god this text is strong. Like this text must go to the gym. Very important text. </strong>

 	<p>You may have seen strong text, but that's nothing to <em>EMPHASIZED TEXT</em></p>

 	<p> Reason this list is just the best.
	 	<ul>
		  	 <li>It's got a first item</li>
		 	 <li>Oh man look at that a second item</li>
		 	 <li>A third item MY GOD</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	 	<p> Yeah, that last list was cool, but it was just a bit unorderly. 
	 	<ol>
		  	 <li>This one's real nice</li>
		 	 <li>No problems with ordering here</li>
		 	 <li>Oh man that's good stuff</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
