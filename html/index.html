	The purpose of semantic tags in html is, from my experience, to make the styling, positioning, and browser behaviors appropriate to it's purpose. (i.e make sure the main content is actually the focus of the page)

	I honestly don't quite understand this question. If it's asking which element's are displayed first then I believe it's sort of dependent on the content, but typically it would be the main or body. 

	I didn't know how to create snippets before, so I definitely learned how to do that. And I do think once i start to write more demanding code i'll find some snippets that don't yet exist that I'll actually need.

	The most difficult concept for me was probably just creating the snippets, mostly because it was the only new content, and also because I had some trouble with the formatting of it.
